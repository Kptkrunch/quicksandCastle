                    You are in dire straights; your castle has crumbled and in sinking into the desert.  What's
                    worse is you have left your loot in the wreckage!  You must at all cost prevent your treasure
                    from falling into the quicksand or you won't be able to afford to rebuild your castle.  Who knows
                    just how deep the sand is, so you must build until your castle stops sinking. Good luck!
